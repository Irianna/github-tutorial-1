## Git vs. GitHub
##### *What is Git*?  
Git is used to administer your code by saving "snapshots" of it. Git helps the coder have basic access to the past revisions of their directory.

Github is a platform that keeps your code online (in the cloud). In order to use this, you need to have Git.

## Initial Setup
##### *How do I make a Github account?*
Creating a Github account is essencial because it will help you push commits to your repository and therefore will enable you to acccess the revision history of your directory. Steps to making a Github account:
1. Go to [github](https://github.com/) and click on "Sign up".  
2. Make a username, add an e-mail adress, and create your password.  
3. Follow the directions to "Choose your plan" and "Tailor your experience".  
4. Now you have your github account. Don't froget to verify your e-mail!

You can now sign into [c9](https://c9.io/) with your Github account. In c9 you can now create your directorys and push any changes to github.
##### *How to create a SSH key between Github and c9:*
Now that you have access to Github and c9 we will need to make a SSH key. Here are some steps to help you complete this task:
1. On [github](https;//github.com/) click on your avatar and then click on settings.
2. Under your _personal settings_ you will see SSH and GPG keys; click on it.
